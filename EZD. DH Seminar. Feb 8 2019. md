FINAL PROJECT = Culminates in a Digital Exhibition of Written Culture of Pompeii in its Spatial and Archaeological Context
	
				How do we get there? 
Inspiration = See [Pompeii exhibition at Science Museum of VA] (https://www.smv.org/explore/exhibits/pompeii-the-immortal-city) first week of seminar; explore Digital Work on Pompeii throughout semester (Dr. Damer will present)

Create 10 schede to publish on EDR (database management, back end of scholarly database)
	Science Museum Pompeii Exhibit
	
Help update design on [AncientGraffiti.org](ancientgraffiti.org)
	

Use Omeka to house images and descriptions of objects, finds, painting, writing associated with your space in Pompeii that you will link to PMBP  

Build .xlsx database housing ranges you want to pop up on PMBP
		
Use [Pompeii Mapping and Bibliography Project](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=084ee7adbe8440078311a48ad12e43cb&extent=1610443.8646%2C4974625.3444%2C1615030.0863%2C4976734.5286%2C102100) on ArcGISOnline

	This Database has open data that we can add to, using Join Features, by building additional layers to interface with the existing richly developed map. 

Problems still: 
	1) How to get our maps to stay put on PMBP data
	2) How to make this visually appealing (i.e. legible to people not in the seminar)
	3) How to share this work for assessment & how to stage this work so we crash only one 	stage at a time




HELP! How do I link on markdown? 
A = Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut command + k to create a link.
